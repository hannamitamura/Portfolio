            GOAL
            <br>
            I designed and prototyped an Arduino-based Pulse Oximeter.
            <br>
            The steps of an engineering design cycle followed for this project are as follows:
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>problem identification</li>
                <li>identification of design space with matched functions and means</li>
                <li>formulation of a solution to meet the constraints/objectives of the project</li>
                <li>modeling of parts and prototyping</li>
                <li>evaluation of the design</li>
            </ol>

            BACKGROUND
            <br>
            Design of a pulse oximeter was of particular interest given the (Covid-19) pandemic and resulting health and
             economic crises the US currently faces. Pulse oximeters as a class offer a quick means of assessing the user’s 
             health without requiring attention from a medical provider. The market for such prescreening devices is expanding due to
            consumer’s pandemic related purchases. The focus of the design project was finding a viable alternative to 
            already commercially available pulse oximeters.

            DESIGN PROCESS
            <br>
            The first step in the design process is determining what problem the engineering design will attempt to address. 
            A problem statement then attempts to refine these goals into a single sentence that can be used as reference for the
             remainder of the design process. 
            <br>
            For this pulse oximeter project the problem statement was as follows:
            <blockquote>Design a quick, non-invasive, accurate way to measure incoming patient peripheral blood
                oxygen saturation levels that will not contribute to infectious disease spread.</blockquote>

            PRELIMINARY SKETCH
            <br>
            Below is an early sketch of a pulse oximeter design that follows from the selected design:

            MATLAB SIGNAL PROCESSING
            <br>
            The next step was physical modeling. This involved first learning how to find voltage output corresponding to different ambient light conditions.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="PulseOxPrelim.png">
            <br>
            Once the selected sensor was confirmed to match voltage to light conditions, the functioning under IR and Red LEDs was checked.
            <br> Signal output was then processed using a digital bandpass filter from the MATLAB Signal Processing Toolbox. 
            <br>The selected range was between 0.5 and 10 Hz, which is the allowable range for a human pulse.

            PHYSICAL MODEL
            <br>
            Because this project is aimed at designing a physical object, some consideration of product packaging was necessary.
            Below is a prototype showing internal layout of the pulse oximeter, with casing made of heavy cardstock.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="PulseOxPrototype.png">
            <br>
            The final design casing should be made of plastic or metal. A model of the casing was also built in SolidWorks (RIGHT).
            <br class="horizontal">
            To both protect fingers and to limit disease spread, patient contact with the pulse oximeter is reduced by use of a disposable paper sleeve, shown below.
