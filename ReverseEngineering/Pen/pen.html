            GOAL
            <br>
            The purpose of this project was to gain a basic understanding of engineering design through the process of reverse engineering a household object,
            in this case a fountain pen, as well as become more familiar with engineering report writing. The pen was disassembled, and its parts documented below.

            BACKGROUND
            <br>
            The product examined was a fountain pen, a writing tool that contains a cartridge for storing a volume of ink and a feed/nib 
            mechanism that uses capillary action to allow the stored ink to flow onto paper in a controlled manner. Within the last century fountain
             pens have largely been phased out in favor of modern ball point pens, which use more viscous ink (less spill-prone) but may cause more muscle strain.

            Fountain pen component naming convention standardized according to (Anatomy of a Fountain Pen, 2020). Carbon Fiber Composites Digital Caliper was
             used for all measurements (Accuracy Â±0.2mm). The Rosso Bianco fountain pen has tightly fitted nib, feed and grip section parts, which did not allow 
             for their separation.

            DESIGN EVALUATION
            <br>
            The pen was designed with as few components as possible to meet its functional needs, which allowed for its mass production and low sale price 
            ($5USD). The type of ink cartridge allowed (and therefore the volume of ink that can be stored) is constrained by the aperture needed to fit the post end of
             the feed, and the length and diameter of the barrel. The narrowed end of the barrel appears to be largely an aesthetic choice, imitating the distinctive 
             silhouette of more expensive fountain pen brands.  This pen is fitted with an international short (industry standard) ink cartridge, which 
             reduces cost for consumers because replacement parts are easily purchased online, but I find it is not as convenient as a larger volumed international long 
             cartridge. As a student, my primary interest is ease of use. When posted, the pen feels unbalanced as a result 
             of shifting the center of mass up away from the grip section.
