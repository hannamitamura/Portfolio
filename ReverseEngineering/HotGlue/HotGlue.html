            An electronic digital caliper was used (Accuracy ±0.2mm). The external casing is held together by 5 identical screws. 
            The heating element is held together by a two metal clips and a rubber adapter collar. The trigger mechanism is wedged
             between the two halves of the external casing. The power cord is clipped to the heating element on one end, while the 
             other runs through the bottom of the external casing to an external power source.

            DESIGN EVALUATION:
            <br>
            The basic functions of a hot glue gun are to pass glue into the heating element, melt the glue, and eject the liquid glue.
             The first basic function is to melt the glue sticks. When the hot glue gun is plugged into a standard 120 volt home wall outlet, 
             a circuit is completed. Electricity flows through one wire of the power cord through the ceramic plate, where some amount of electrical
              energy is released as heat, and back out through the second wire.  The aluminum body transfers some of that heat 
              to the glue stick, which then melts. The interior of the hot glue gun does not overheat because the ceramic plate is a PTC heater, a 
              “positive temperature coefficient” material, which means that its resistance to current flow increases as temperature increases. 
              The use of PTC ceramic allows the hot glue gun to “self-regulate” temperature. The manufacturer of the hot glue gun seems to have 
              chosen to use PTC ceramic and an aluminum body for the heating element to avoid material and manufacturing costs associated with a heat 
              sensor/warning light system and separate temperature controls. 
              <br>
              <br>
            The second function, linear movement of a glue stick through the barrel of a hot glue gun, is achieved by a trigger mechanism. 
            Though possible to push a glue stick through the glue gun barrel manually, it is not the most convenient method as it requires either greater
             single-handed dexterity or the use of two hands. The inconvenience of Push-fed glue guns outweighs the benefit of requiring fewer parts 
             (simpler manufacture), which is likely why an Amazon.com search of ‘hot glue guns,’ and ‘craft glue guns,’ will pull up only products with
              trigger mechanisms. The majority of glue guns with triggers are manual, though “automatic,” motor-driven glue guns do exist. The 
              mechanical trigger was likely selected for the hot glue gun model used for this reverse engineering project because it strikes a balance 
              between low manufacturing costs and ease of use for the consumer.
